## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Flash Reels is an AI-powered video creation platform that enables users to generate professional reels and short videos with just a few clicks. The platform combines multiple AI services to automate the entire video creation workflow—from script generation to final video rendering.

The main idea is straightforward: users provide a topic, select their preferences for style, voice, and caption design, and the platform handles the rest. It generates a script using Google Gemini, creates AI images using Fal.ai's Flux model, converts text to speech using Microsoft Edge TTS, generates synchronized captions with Deepgram, and renders the final video using Remotion.

**I built it** to make video creation accessible to everyone. No video editing skills required—just creativity and an idea. The platform handles all the technical complexity behind the scenes, allowing creators to focus on their content.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Want to run Flash Reels locally? Here's what you need to do.

### What You Need First

- Node.js version 18 or newer
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun
- A PostgreSQL database (I use Neon)
- API keys for the following services:
  - Clerk (authentication)
  - Google Gemini (script generation)
  - Fal.ai (image generation)
  - Deepgram (caption generation)
  - Cloudinary (media storage)
  - GitHub Personal Access Token (for video rendering workflow)

### Getting It Running

1. **Grab the code**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/FlashReels.git
   cd FlashReels
   ```

2. **Install everything**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up your environment**
   
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add all required environment variables (see [Environment Variables](#environment_variables) section below).

4. **Set up the database**

   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

   This will create the necessary tables in your PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM.

5. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The site should be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🎈 Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

### What It Does

1. **Create New Video**
   - Navigate to the "Create New" page from the dashboard
   - Enter a topic for your video
   - Select an image style (e.g., Realistic, Artistic, Cinematic)
   - Choose a voice for text-to-speech
   - Pick a caption style (Classic, Supreme, Glitch, Fire, Futuristic)
   - Optionally set the video duration
   - Click "Create" and wait for the AI to generate your video

2. **Video Generation Workflow**
   - The platform generates a script using Google Gemini based on your topic
   - AI images are created for each scene using Fal.ai's Flux model
   - Text-to-speech audio is generated using Microsoft Edge TTS
   - Captions are automatically generated with Deepgram for perfect synchronization
   - All assets are uploaded to Cloudinary for storage
   - The video data is saved to the database

3. **Video Rendering**
   - Once created, videos can be rendered using Remotion
   - Rendering is handled via GitHub Actions workflow
   - The rendered video is available for download

4. **Dashboard**
   - View all your created videos
   - See video status (generating, completed, etc.)
   - Access video details and editing options

5. **Community**
   - Browse videos created by other users
   - Search and filter videos
   - View public video content

6. **Favorites**
   - Save videos you like to your favorites
   - Quick access to your favorite content

### The Video Creation Flow

1. User selects topic and preferences
2. AI generates a script with scene descriptions
3. AI creates images for each scene
4. Text-to-speech converts script to audio
5. Captions are generated with precise timing
6. All assets are stored in Cloudinary
7. Video data is saved to the database
8. User can render and download the final video
